    "text": "1. Design Principles\n\n1.1 Consistency\n\nDefinition: Ensuring that design elements are uniform across the application, providing users with a predictable and intuitive experience.\nImportance:\n\nUser Expectations: Consistent design helps users build familiarity and understanding of how to interact with the system.\nUsability: Reduces the learning curve and potential errors by maintaining uniformity in design patterns and interactions.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Visibility\n\nDefinition: Making important elements and functions visible and easily accessible to users.\nImportance:\n\nDiscoverability: Users should be able to find features and actions without extensive searching.\nClarity: Ensures that users are aware of their current options and status within the application.\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Feedback\n\nDefinition: Providing users with clear and immediate responses to their actions within the system.\nImportance:\n\nUser Assurance: Feedback confirms that actions have been successfully completed or if there are errors.\nInteraction Confirmation: Helps users understand the effects of their actions and provides guidance on how to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Affordance\n\nDefinition: Design elements should suggest their functionality through their appearance.\nImportance:\n\nIntuitive Interaction: Buttons, icons, and other elements should visually indicate their purpose (e.g., buttons should look clickable).\nEase of Use: Users can easily understand how to interact with elements based on their design."
