Types of Software\n- **Question**: Differentiate between application software and system software. Provide examples of each and discuss their respective roles in a computer system.\n\n### 2. Database Management Systems (DBMS)\n- **Question**: Explain the key differences between relational and NoSQL databases. Describe a scenario where each type would be the most suitable choice.\n\n### 3. Networking Basics\n- **Question**: Define and describe the purpose of common networking protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, and DNS. How do these protocols contribute to network communication?\n\n## Part 2: Practical Exercise\n\n### Software System Design\n\nYou are tasked with designing a software system for a small business that needs to manage customer orders and inventory. Your design should address the following aspects:\n\n1. **Database Design**:\n   - **Schema**: Design a simple database schema for managing customer orders and inventory. Include tables for customers, orders, and products, and define the relationships between them.\n   - **Use Case**: Explain how the database schema supports common queries and operations, such as adding new orders, updating inventory, and retrieving customer information.\n\n2. **Networking Considerations**:\n   - **Network Architecture**: Describe the network architecture for the business, including how the system will be accessed by employees and any external stakeholders (e.g., customers placing orders online).\n   - **Security**: Outline basic security measures to protect the data and ensure secure communication between the client and server.\n\n3. **Software Design Principles**:\n   - **Design Principles**: Apply design principles such as consistency, visibility, feedback, and affordance to the user interface of the system. Explain how each principle is incorporated into the design.\n   - **User Interface**: Describe the layout and interactive elements of the user interface, including any wireframes or mockups if applicable.\n\n### Submission Guidelines:\n- **Document Format**: Submit your answers and practical exercise in a PDF or Word document.\n- **Length**: Aim for a total of 5-7 pages, including diagrams and mockups.\n- **Deadline**: November 18, 2024\n\n---\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
